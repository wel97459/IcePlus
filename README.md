# IcePlus
Decomp of the game Iceblox Plus by Karl HÃ¶rnell

This also contains a port of the game to C that is correctly a playable work in progress.

Compiling is straight forward:

```bash
sudo apt install libSDL2-dev libSDL2_mixer-dev
cmake .
make
```

With devkitpro installed for N1ntendo Switch development you can build the game targeting the Switch.
